App name: AvidRunner

Names: Stanley Wu, Ian Figon, Brandon Chen, Vanely Ruiz

Purpose: An all encompassing running app that allows runners to find times to run, set music for the run, and track/save running routes
and statistics.

The user can use the scheduling activity to find gaps in their schedule as well as compare those gaps with the weather forecast 
for today or tomorrow. In addition, the app allows the user to connect with Spotify to set up a playlist of music to play. The user can
then start their run and track their route, distance and time and save this information for future reference.
